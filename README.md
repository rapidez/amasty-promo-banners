# Rapidez Amasty Promo Banners

## Requirements

You need to have the [Amasty Promo Banners](https://amasty.com/promo-banners-for-magento-2.html) module installed and configured within your Magento 2 installation.

## Installation

```
composer require rapidez/amasty-promo-banners
```

If you haven't published the Rapidez views yet, you can publish them with:
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Rapidez\Core\RapidezServiceProvider" --tag=views
```

## Usage

### Categories

Add `@banners('category_page', $category->entity_id)` where you'd like to display your banners, add the specified location to make sure the banner shows up on the location you've specified in magento backend. The possible locations are listed at [locations](#Locations). For categories, you can just pass the category id in the blade directive to make sure it only displays for the selected categories in the Magento backend.

### Products

#### With product rules

If you want the banners to be rendered conditional (based on magento rules), you can pass the product as object to the banners directive:
`@banners('prod_page', $product)`.
This will display the banners for all products that passes the conditions.

#### Without product rules

If you just want to show the banner on some product pages, you can pass the SKU in the banners directive:
`@banners('prod_page', $product->sku)`
This will only display the banner for the specified SKUs in the Magento backend.

### Among category products

Just add the view within the `renderItem` slot in `listing/partials/item.blade.php`
```
@includeWhen(config('frontend.category'), 'AmastyPromoBanners::promobanners.amongproducts')
```

You should also use `getListingSize(...)` as the page size in your `products.blade.php`, for example like so:

```blade
<reactive-list
    [...]
    :size="getListingSize(parseInt(listingSlotProps.pageSize))"
    [...]
>
```

## Views

If you need to change the views you can publish them with:
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Rapidez\AmastyPromoBanners\AmastyPromoBannersServiceProvider" --tag=views
```

These are the locations that are configurable in the magento backend for each banner.
